# 2.5-Switch-Cases

### Create a program that:
1. Has the user enter a super power (flight, strength, speed, intelligence, or other) you can add more if you'd like
2. Use a switch to decide what superhero their mentor will be based on the power they chose (i.e. intelligence -> Your mentor is Iron Man)
3. Have the user enter their superhero name after they get their mentor.
4. Output something like: 
(the super hero name) will be mentored by (mentor name)  
  
  
###After you're done your program
edit this readme file and write underneath in 2-5 sentences why you would use switch over if statements AND why you would use if statements over switch statements.
